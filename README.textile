Python code for converting GeoDjango features into 0-referenced SVG strings for vector-based mapping. The code is designed to work with Raphael JS (http://raphaeljs.com) -- because Raphael provides fairly robust VML backup code for legacy Internet Explorer browsers -- but can be used without Raphael as well if you want to use other libraries.

The repository includes a Django project with sample code for two examples: a basic layer map with polygon, linestring and point layers; and a choropleth map that connects with related data in a separate JSON file.

A few working examples of slightly older versions of the svg_map.py code:
